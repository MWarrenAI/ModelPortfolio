	<h1> 3D Scanning </h1>
	<p> The 3D scanners originally used produced models of a subject that was sitting down/standing up. This required the subject to remain stationary while the scanning took place. </p>
	<br>
	<h2> Handyscan 3D Scanner </h2>
	<br>
	<p> The scanner generates high resolution mesh models which can move during measurements to produce a high-quality scan. With an accuracy of around 0.012-0.025mm (Creaform, 2023).
An example of industrial use would be for recording physical attributes of aircraft models for Boeing commercial airplanes (Quality Magazine, 2019).

<p>Figure 25 Subject with Scanner Markers placed upon him (photograph taken by Michael Alcock)</p>
<br>
<p>We found that the scan while accurate required the use of these 3D Scanner markers. They are small circular discs that are spaced around the object so that the scanner has a reference point in order to recognise an object surface. This would require a minimum of 3 markers with 5 being for the most optimum object surface for 70*100cm space (Thor3D, 2016). While accurate the model could not correctly render the facial hair of the subject, this also meant some facial features were missed due to the limitation of the markers. This made the result not as good as we desired as we would need to spend far longer creating the mesh of the face in order to produce a usable model. Also, the lack of colour of the scan meant we would still need to colour this ourselves. Thus we did not make use of the model produced. The handyscan fired lasers in order to get the geometry of a subject.</p> 
	<br>
	<h2> Artec Eva 3D Scanner </h2>
	<br>
<p>Portable scanner which makes use of structured light scanning technology. This uses geometry and texture tracking for full colour scanning and data alignment (Central Scanning, 2020). </p> 
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig26.jpg" alt = "Figure 26: Artec Eva 3D Scanner (photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>

<br>
<p>Another alternative we used for the 3D Scanner was the Artec 3D Eva Scanner. This was a similar set up as before: instead of standing however we had the subject sitting and the scanner would flash the subject with lights and capture the reflection in order to obtain colour. There wasn’t a difference in the quality of standing/sitting but made the process faster than sticking markers on the subject’s head. We found the model to be of a satisfactory quality – while not as accurate we found that we had the model did not miss any facial features. These features were then simply smoothed out and holes were cut out from the eye sockets using Blender’s Boolean tool. After smoothing out the hair, we were left with a base that could be printed out using a 3D printer.</p> 
	<br>
<p>An Industrial example of the Scanner would be perioperative volumetric assessment of a knee Latz et al, 2022). </p>
