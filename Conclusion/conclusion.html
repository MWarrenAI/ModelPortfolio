	<h1> Conclusion </h1>
	<br>
	<p>While deemed a success: the model itself had the potential to be mass producted: but due to cost 3D printing is ill advised.</p>
	<br>
	<p>If the project was done again, the team would look at the possibility of using resign or vacumm forming as this would be a more efficent process if done correctly.
	<br>
	<p>The joints on the other hand could be improved so that the hinge and mechanism allowed the doors on the back of the head to sit flat against the head and could also be attached to a full human body.
	<br>
	<p>Better speakers could be created (externally) which would improve the audio quality as well as the overall function of the design. Arduino could then be further adopted down the line to allow for human interaction, etc.
	<br>
	<p>The possibility of moving eyes could also be included as this was a rejected idea due to budget and time constraints.
	<br>
	<p>Overall, with the given resources (body filler, Halfords stocked primer and paint and 3D printer) the team were able to deliver a solution that used industrial grade products.
