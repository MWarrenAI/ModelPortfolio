	<p>While deemed a success: the model itself had the potential to be mass produced: but due to cost 3D printing is ill advised. If the project was done again, the team would look at the possibility of using resin or vacumm forming. Printing the head with a skin tone instead could have been considered for cost.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The joints on the other hand could be improved so that the hinge and mechanism allowed the doors on the back of the head to sit flat against the head and could also be attached to a full human body. Better speakers could be created (externally) Arduino for human interaction. The possibility of moving eyes could also be included.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Overall, with the given resources (body filler, Halfords stocked primer and paint and 3D printer) the team were able to deliver a solution that used industrial grade products.<p>
