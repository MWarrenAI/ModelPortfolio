	<h1>Concept Design </h1>
	<br>
	<p>Mark Warren and Michael Alcock decided on a basic MOSCOW to get a general gist of what was expected to be achieved from the project.</p>

	<p> The design was planned: a rough sketch on a whiteboard and discussion of general dimensions of Michaelâ€™s head with use of measuring tape.</p>

	<br>
	<p>A discussion was held about the general motor mechanics, the visualised hinge and measurements of the eyes and dimensions. The technology agreed on would involve the 3D Printer, Blender, Fusion 360, use of a 3D Scanner (yet to be decided) and MP3 Module (for speaker use).  The available tools for use of project were then examined: please refer to the Development section of the website.</p>
