	<h1> Concept Design </h1>
	<br>
	<p> To begin with Mark Warren and Michael Alcock decided on a basic MOSCOW to get a general gist of what we expected to achieve from our overall project.</p>
	<br>
	<h2> Requirement Document for Head </h2>
	<br>
	<h3> Must </h3>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li> Construct a physical concept of the head.</li>
		<li> Construct a separate manakin head for structure.</li>
		<li> Construct skin from scan using a Design tool.</li>
		<li> Scanner for the skin.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3> Should </h3>
	<ul>
	<br>
		<li> Extend the design to move the Hinges. </li>
		<li> Construct Hinges.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3> Could </h3>
	<ul>
	<br>
		<li> Construct Eyes. </li>
		<li> Hair. </li>
		<li> Additional Motors to control eyes. </li>
		<li> Speaker for sounds.</li>
		<li> Colour Scanner.</li>
		<li> Include a series of Motors to control hinges. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3> Won't </h3>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li> Be for commercial use. </li>
		<li> Fly. </li>
		<li> Use Machine Learning to create conversations. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p> We then moved onto the planning of our design: we made a rough sketch on a whiteboard and discussed the general dimensions of Michaelâ€™s head using some measuring tape I had at the time.</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig3.jpg" alt = "Figure 3: Visual representation of Motor Movements inside head (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
<p>Figure 3 Visual representation of Motor Movements inside head (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)</p>
<br>
<p>In Figure 3, we discussed the general motor mechanics and what the general movements of the motors would produce. </p>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig4.jpg" alt = "Figure 4: Visual Representation of hinge holding head (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
<p>Figure 4 Visual Representation of hinge holding head (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)</p>
<br>
<p>In figure 4, we visualised where the hinge would be using a projector and autodesk 123D Design Software. </p>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig5.jpg" alt = "Figure 5: Hinge Visual Representation (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
<p>Figure 5 Hinge Visual Representation (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)</p>
<br>
<p>We finally then made approximate measurements of the eyes. </p>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig6.jpg" alt = "Figure 6: Tool used to measure eye distance and eye width/height (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>

<br>
<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig7.jpg" alt = "Figure 7: Measurements of distance between centre of eyes and the eye width (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
<p>Figure 7 Measurements of distance between centre of eyes and the eye width (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)</p>
<br>
	<br>
	<p> After visually discussing the rough measurements required we then examined the available tools for use of our project: please refer to each section for more information which shall lead you onto my conclusion. </p>
