	<h1>Detailed Development</h1>
	<br>
	<p>To further justify the means of our design approach other areas were explored and evaluated for their use and purpose in terms of potential utility for the design.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Mocap</h2>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig52.jpg" alt = "Figure 30: Screenshot of Recording of Swordfight between two Actors (Recording provided by Staffordshire University, Screenshot taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
	<p>Figure 30 Screenshot of Recording of Swordfight between two Actors (Recording provided by Staffordshire University, Screenshot taken by Mark Warren) </p>
	<br>
	<p>Mocap (short for Motion Capture) is used to manipulate computer generated objects that can be used for visual effects such as making a solid object move visually. This records the movement of people or objects creating a photorealistic effect that can be mapped to models in order to recreate scenes. This is usually used for Film, TV, Video Games, Health, Sport and Military (Adobe, 2023). </p>
	<br>
	<p>Motion capture is achieved either via motion capture suits or X-base markers in which the spheres can be tracked by cameras (Nymoen, K., No Date). The advantages is that this produced low latency animations, doesn’t require too much training, provides realistic movements and a large amount of data can be produced. The disadvantages however, are the software and hardware need to be specific, it can be costly, limited by field of view of the camera, retakes may be needed if a motion capture was not done right or had problems which would take time(Adobe, 2023). </p> 
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig53.jpg" alt = "Figure 31: Manipulation Result from Recording of Swordfight between two Actors with use of Shogun Live Software (Recording provided by Staffordshire University, Screenshot taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
	<p>Figure 31 Manipulation Result from Recording of Swordfight between two Actors with use of Shogun Live Software (Recording provided by Staffordshire University, Screenshot taken by Mark Warren) </p>
	<br>
	<p>An industrial example of Motion Capture would be predicting 3D keypoints of body parts to capture full-body human performance (Li, K., Mao, Y. Liu, Y. Shao, R., 2020). </p>
	<br>
	<p>The possibility is there if we wish to demonstrate the movement of our head but has no practical purpose of the overall design of the head. </p>
	<br>
	<h2>Laser Cutting/Trotec Speedy Run</h2>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig30.jpg" alt = "Figure 32: Laser Cutting (photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
	<p>Figure 32 Laser Cutting (photograph taken by Mark Warren) </p>
	<br>
	<p> Trotec Speedy 400 Run on Ruby has a working area of 1016 (width) x 610 (diameter) mm this allows for engraving and cutting of various material (Acrylics, Glass, Plastic Sheets, etc) (Trotec Laser GmbH, 2023).</p>
	<br>
	<p>Laser cutting is achieved through the use of Adobe Illustrator Software. You require a material to use as base so that the laser can be used on the material to burn lines into the material to create cut shapes or burn patterns onto the material. The software relies on basic black and white writing/drawings which can then later be turned into your result. The advantage is that you can create burned images and cut out desired shapes. However, this is limited by the person’s ability to design, the material used can affect the desired outcome and the canvas cannot exceed the space the laser cutter has allocated – which means the material used has to be of a restrained size. We did not make use of Laser Cutting as there was no practical use for the artifact. </p>
	<br>
	<p>An application of this technology would be cutting a cardiovascular stent out of a 316L stainless steel tube (Sharma, A., Yadava, V., 2018)</p>
	<br>
	<h2>3D Printer</h2>
	<p>The design needed to be further evaluated via a 3D Printer to ensure this was the best approach for the design. A smaller version of the head was printed out to understand how we wanted to proceed in scale for the design.
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/ahead.jpg" alt = "Figure 33: Mini Michael Head (photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
	<p>Later it was decided that because of hinges we wanted on the back of the head this would need to be rescaled so that the proportions would be more manageable as the head was too small to work with.</p>
	<br>
	<h1> 3D Systems Touch X Haptic Modelling Arm  </h1>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig31.png" alt = "Figure 33 Using the Haptic Modelling Arm (Photograph taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>
	<br>
	<p> Figure 33 Using the Haptic Modelling Arm (Photograph taken by Mark Warren) </p>
	<br>
	<p>The Touch X Modelling Arm applies haptic feedback to simulate a 3d environment of an object – this allows the device to offer movement in 6 dimension of positional sensing and 3 dimensions of freedom force feedback. You can work in a space of around 355mm(width) x 228mm(height) x 180mm(diameter) and a force of around 1.75 Newtons can be applied to the pen in order to achieve results. The pen uses force feedback in order to establish to the user that there is a physical object being drawn upon.</p>

	<br>
	<p> Figure 34 Smoothing Poro's tongue (photo taken by Mark Warren) </p>
	<br>
	<p>Various tools can be used to carve, create mesh objects and modify shapes created using the pen and Geomagic Freeform software. </p>
	<br>
	<a><img class="img" src ="../Assets/images/photos/Fig33.jpg" alt = "Figure 35 Painting Poro mesh tongue (photo taken by Mark Warren)"/></a>

	<br>
	<p>Figure 36 Finished Poro Modelling version 1 (photograph taken by Mark Warren) </p>
	<br>
	<p>We found that the pen had limited use for our model – we chose not to make use of the pen since this would have costed us time and money to adapt to the size we wanted to print out: similar issue with the 3D printed head. If given time and money we may have made use of the pen as this would have offered us a means to create our own tone for skin but because of personal preference and tool available in Blender software we found we couldn’t implement changes we would have liked such as easily manipulating the shapes produced as the pen would only be available at Staffordshire University itself thereby meaning the pen is not as portable as we would have liked for the project. </p>
	<br>
	<p>An industry example of the pen would be use for surgical interns to perform accurate surgery using the pen to simulate a medical procedure (Wade, A., 2018). </p>
	<br>
	<p>The poro itself came out great and minatures of the original were handed out - the Staffordshire University staff were so impressed of the quality of the Poro that they decided to showcase the design as examples of what the pen is capable of.
