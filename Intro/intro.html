	<h2> Head Scaled Down Project </h2>
	<br>
	<p> This Head project was inspired by the scene from MIB where James Edwards played by Will Smith discovers an alien masquerading as a human via a robot. We would be modelling a Head that would house gears and control eyes and hinges of the face to mimic that of a talking head.</p>
<br>
<p>Originally, the scene was going to be a throwaway reveal that aliens were among us by having the bartender reveal a light from underneath his skin: the creator thought this was too lackluster and so opted for a more interesting reveal that the body was being piloted by a tiny alien sitting inside the head. The idea was liked so much that they removed the bartender scene entirely and replaced the scene with an autopsy where the body was lying on a morgue table which showed the likeness of the actor and the scene played out opening up to reveal said alien (Mark, S., 2017).</p>
<br>
<p>Industrial Light & Magic achieved this via a combination of models, replicas, sets robots and Computer Generated Effects. This allowed the computer generated character to be conveyed in conjunction with the technical aspects of the creation (Industrial Light & Magic, No date).</p>
<br>
<p>To achieve this project various tools were used to discover and manufacture the head and head hinges to achieve an autonomous talking head. We therefore have to look at the STL Viewer, Blender, Fusion360, Handyscan 3D, Artec Eva 3D Scanner, 3D Systems Touch X pen, Laser Cutting, Latex and Latex printing.</p> 
<br>
<p>We need to evaluate the use of these tools and reflect on how well we thought the project went – what tools were relevant and how the implementation and use of these tools helped. Please refer to the about section of this website for more information about each element. To begin please start by reading the project plan and browse through the various tools that should lead you onto my conclusion of the project whole.</p>
