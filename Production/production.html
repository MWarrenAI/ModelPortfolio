	<p> We found that use of these tools were quite limited for the purposes of the project overall – we had to therefore improvise with own method to print the model of the head. After scanning (refer to 3D Scan page) we used Blender (smoothing the top of the head and cutting out the eyes), a 3D Printer and printed the head out of Polylactic Acid. </p>

	<p> This allowed us to have a durable structure without losing detail. We cut apart the back of the head and sanded it down to improve the overall look of the head after applying Primer. </p>

	<p> The Hinges were 3d printed out of Polylactic Acid as well we modelled this ourselves making use of Blender and Fusion 360 so that we could open the back of the head so that we had access to the speaker inside. The speaker is operated by a USB. If we had more time or money we would have added additional features to the head such as eye or mouth movement and door handles for back of the head but given the time constraints and budget we accomplished what we set out to do in the MOSCOW. </p>
