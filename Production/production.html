	<h1>Production</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Use of these tools were quite limited for the purposes of the project overall – the team improvised a different approach to print the model of the head. After scanning (refer to the Development Section) Blender was used (smoothing the top of the head and cutting out the eyes), and a 3D Printer printed the head out of Polylactic Acid. </p>

	<p>A modified file in Blender was used for the purposes of the head artefact (refer to figure 33). An alternative blender file was considered for 3D print with colour but was not used due to agreements of using primer instead and budget concerns (refer to figure 34). To begin production, a 3D Printer "Ender 3" was used for the project. Costing £210.00, the printer could print out the skin accurately, we smoothed over the hair with use of Blender Software to give the head a smoother look. Hanging areas were required to support the structure of the head whilst printing (later removed). The print was of a satisfactory nature suitable for prototyping (refer to figure 35 and 36). </p>

	<p>The project made use of a mini breadboard and a MP3 module. The MP3 module would play music through the head when played.</p>

	<br>
	<p>The distance between the ears was used as a rough guideline to find the center of the head, and cut apart the head.</p>

	<br>
	<p>This allowed us to have a durable structure without losing detail. We cut apart the back of the head (with use of a dremmel) and sanded it down (with use of 80/120 grit sandpaper) to improve the overall look of the head after applying Primer. </p>

	<p>Body Filler Upol easy was used to repair gaps caused by the dremmel (provided by Staffordshire University). This mixture when applied will set to gaps in the head after roughly 15 minutes.

	<br>
	<p>A concept for the door handles for the back of the head was considered but rejected due to this ruining the overall look of the head. Further sanding was required to smooth over the body filler so it could then be prepared for the primer.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Filler Primer was first applied to the head model to fill in gaps (e.g. adhesion layers), multiple layers were applied. A ventilated spray booth was used for the safety spraying indoors (refer to figure 46). White coat primer provided a uniformal colouring to regulate final colour, multiple layers were applied. A ventilated spray booth was used for the safety spraying indoors. Camouflage paint was then applied, no skin tone colour was available for industry use at halfords. Multiple layers were applied. A ventilated spray booth was used for the safety spraying indoors (refer to figure 46). </p>
	<br>
	<p>The Hinges were 3d printed out of Polylactic Acid and this was modelled making use of Blender and Fusion 360 so that the back of the head could be opened so that there was access to the speaker inside. The speaker is operated by a USB. If more time or money had been allocated, additional features to the head such as eye or mouth movement and door handles for back of the head but given the time constraints and budget: the MOSCOW requirements were satisfied.</p>
